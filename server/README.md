1. Given a make and model of a car, the average price youd get a deal for.
2. Given a location, what type of cars are being sold and how likely your make and model will be sold.
3. Given a location, show all the cars that are competition for you and make a datavis tool to show it in. relation to your car.
4. Add a datavis graph to show how the model is trending.
